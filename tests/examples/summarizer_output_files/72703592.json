Accordingly, while upholding the impugned order on merit we reduce the amount of penalty from Rs. 50 Lakh to Rs. 20 Lakh.\nAppellant is directed to pay this amount to SEBI within a period of 30 days from the date of this order.\n12. Appeal is partly allowed in above terms.\nNo orders on costs.\n"}}
