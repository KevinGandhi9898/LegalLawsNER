Harbhajan Singh Bajwa and Ors. 2000(4) R.C.R. (Crl.) 650 (SC) : AIR 2001 S.C. 43, it was observed as under:\n \nThe filing of a miscellaneous petition not referable to any provision of Code of Criminal Procedure or the rules of the Court, cannot be resorted to as a substitute of fresh litigation.\nMerely because the respondent No. 1 was an Advocate, did not justify the issuance of directions at his request without notice of the other side.\nThe practice of filing miscellaneous petitions after the disposal of the main case and issuance of fresh directions in such miscellaneous not referable to any statutory provisions and in substance the abuse of the process of the Court.\nHowever, the power under Article 227 is a discretionary power and it is difficult to attribute to an order of the High Court, such a source of power, when the High Court itself does not in terms purport to exercise any such discretionary power.\nIt is settled law that this power of judicial superintendence, under Article 227, must be exercised sparingly and only to keep subordinate courts and tribunals within the bound of their authority and not to correct mere errors.\nFurther, where the statute banned the exercise of revisional powers it would require very exceptional circumstances to warrant interference under Article 227 of the Constitution of India since the power of superintendence was not meant to circumvent statutory law.\nIt is settled law that the jurisdiction under Article 227 could not be exercised \"as the cloak of an appeal in disguise.\nThus the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Sectin 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code can be exercised even when there is a bar under Section 397 or some other provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nIf the order assailed is purely of an interlocutory character, which could be corrected in exercise of revisional powers or appellate powers the High Court must refuse to exercise its inherent power.\nThe inherent power is to be used only in cases where there is an abuse of the process of the Court or where interference is absolutely necessary for securing the ends of justice.\nThe inherent power must be exercised very sparingly as cases which require interference would be few and far between.\nThis power should not be exercised against an express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nIn State through Special Cell, New Delhi v. Navjot Sandhu alias Afshan Guru and Ors. 2003(2) R.C.R. (Crl.) 860(SC),\nThe power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. cannot be a hostage to one class or category of cases.\nto give effect to any order under it or to prevent the abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. \n32. The wide amplitude of this provision of law cannot be diminished by any myopic interpretation and any straightjacket prescritption. \n33.\n\n35. To conclude, it can safely be said that there can never be any hard and fast category which can be prescribed to enable the Court to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\nThe only principle that can be laid down is the one which has been incorporated in the Section itself, i.e., \"to prevent abuse of the process of any Court\" or \"to secure the ends of justice\". \n36.\nThe compromise, in a modern society, is the sine qua non of harmony and orderly behaviour.\nDisputes which have their genesis in a matrimonial discord, landlord-tenant matters, commercial transactions and other such matters can safely be dealt with by the Court by exercising its powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in the event of a compromise, but this is not to say that the power is limited to such cases.\nThere can never be any such rigid rule to prescribe the exercise of such power, especially in the absence of any premonitions to forecast and predict eventualities which the cause of justice may throw up during the course of a litigation.\n41. The power under Section 482 of the Cr.\nP.C. is to be exercised Ex-Debitia Justitia to prevent an abuse of process of Court.\nThere can neither be an exhaustive list nor the defined para-meters to enable a High Court to invoke or exercise its inherent powers.\nIt will always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\nThe power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. has no limits.\nHowever, the High Court will exercise it sparingly and with utmost care and caution.\nThe exercise of power has to be with circumspection and restraint.\nThe Court is a vital and an extra-ordinary effective instrument to maintain and control social order.\nThe Courts play role of paramount importance in achieving peace, harmony and ever-lasting congeniality in society.\nResolution of a dispute by way of a compromise between two warring groups, therefore, should attract the immediate and prompt attention of a Court which should endeavour to give full effect to the same unless such compromise is abhorrent to lawful composition of the society or would promote savagery. \n42.\n", "decision": "\n10.

Cheema, learned Senior Advocate, who assisted the Bench as Amicus Curiae, highlighted the inadequacies of the criminal justice system in order to propound and promote the principle that under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., the High Court can effectively exercise its power in an appropriate case and intervene to quash an F.I.R. even when the case discloses a non-compoundable offence and where the parties have voluntarily entered into a compromise.\n"}}
